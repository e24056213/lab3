n=1000: 
  sort(): 0.000207 seconds
  v1/v2 are different.
  insertion_sort(): 0.010311 seconds
  v1/v2 are the same.

n=10000:
  sort(): 0.002717 seconds
  v1/v2 are different.
  insertion_sort(): 0.860126 seconds
  v1/v2 are the same.
  
n=100000:
  sort(): 0.035008 seconds
  v1/v2 are different.
